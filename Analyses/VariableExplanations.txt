Each line represents an estimate included in the meta-regression

RecordNo- unique study ID
Author- first author of the study
Year- year the study was published
LatinName- latin name of the study organism
CommonName- English common name of the study organism
Class- taxonomic class of the study organism
StudyPop- country in which the study was conducted
GroupID_global- Unique ID associated with the group of organisms for which the statistic is extracted when model has fitness component as moderator. Several unique groups may be associated with the same study.
GroupID_fitness_component- Unique id associated with the group of organisms for which the statistic is extracted when different fitness components or treatments are modelled separately. Several unique groups may be associated with the same study.
Origin- w = wild-caught animals tested in captivity
	f = free-living animals, tested in wild
	l = lab or captive-reared animals, tested in captivity
	d = domesticated animals, tested in captivity
Sex- 	m = males
	f = females
	b = both sexes combined
	u = unknown (sex not specified)

FitnessMeasured- 	nat= outside of lab or zoo conditions, no manipulation of food or predation
			art= ex situ observation of fitness, i.e. in a lab, zoo, predator exclosure
Behaviour- behaviour type, as defines in Table S4
BehavCoding- 	categorical= behaviour displayed by organisms is fitted into categories
		continuous= behaviour is quantified in a continuously

BehavDetails- Detailed description of how the behaviour was observed and quantified
LevelBehav- 	phenotypic= unpartitioned phenotypic correlation
		among= phenotypic among-individual, from studies that first extracted BLUPs, used individual averages, or among-individual covariance from a multivariate mixed effects model, or genetic among-individual
		within= phenotypic within-individual centered or the within-individual covariance from a multivariate mixed effects model
LevelFit- 	phenotypic= unpartitioned phenotypic correlation
		among= phenotypic among-individual, from studies that first extracted BLUPs, used individual averages, an among-individual covariance from a multivariate mixed effects model, or genetic among-individual
		within= phenotypic within-individual centered or the within-individual covariance from a multivariate mixed effects model
Level_GroupID- Unique number within a study to indicate paired estimates when a partitioned and unpartitioned estimate are available for the same fitness-behaviour estimate. 0 indicates that the estimate is not paired with another.
NInd- The number of individuals observed for computing the provided effect
